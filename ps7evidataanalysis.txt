Experiment: In my experiment, participants will view a series of face-context images (half these images will be viewed once, and half the images will be viewed four times), and then will get tested on whether they can recognize or feel that the faces are familiar when the context is switched. This is meant to measure facial recognition and familiarity in individuals with aMCI. The independent variables will be the participant group (healthy young adults, healthy older adults, older adults with aMCI), the amount of times an image is repeated (either once or four times), and face condition in the test phase (studied face-studied context, studied face-new context, new face-new context). The dependent variable will be recognition accuracy (hits minus false alarms) identified through confidence level. Pseudocode:- Read in data from excel- Categorize participants according to participant group (0, 1, 2)- Categorize all images with 0 (shown once) and 1 (shown four times)- Categorize all test images according to condition (0, 1, 2)- Get rid of participants with missing data. - Calculate hits (correct recognition of an old face) and false alarms (incorrect recognition of a new face) for each image. (hits as 1 and false alarms as 0)- Calculate hits – FA per condition, per participant group, per image repetition. - Conduct a 3-way ANOVA with hits – FA as the DV. - Conduct a ROC curve of hits and false alarms across the 6 different confidence intervals, to get a measurement of recollection and familiarity. - Do two more 3 way-ANOVAs (with group, condition, and repetition) for estimates of familiarity (d’) and estimates of recollection (R) derived from the ROC curves, as well as two more 3 way-ANOVAs with ‘familiar’ judgements and ‘recollection’ judgements.
